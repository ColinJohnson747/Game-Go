# Game-Go
## Concept
Every gamer has been there before. You’re bored playing the same old games over and over and just don’t know where to look next. GameGo has got you covered. The GameGo site is your new go to for finding  new games to play based on the the criteria that you specify, but with a twist! Rather than having you search just to scour long lists for games that peak your interest, we’ll pick a random one to show you! If you don’t like it, search again. When you find one you like save it to your profile, so that you can access it at any time. 

## Usage
To use and test the application you can navigate to https://game-go-randomizer.herokuapp.com/
Or download the code locally and run node server.js to host it locally.
